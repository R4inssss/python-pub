You learned all about dictionaries in this chapter. Lists and dictionaries are values that can contain multiple values, including other lists and dictionaries. Dictionaries are useful because you can map one item (the key) to another (the value), as opposed to lists, which simply contain a series of values in order. Values inside a dictionary are accessed using square brackets just as with lists. Instead of an integer index, dictionaries can have keys of a variety of data types: integers, floats, strings, or tuples. By organizing a program’s values into data structures, you can create representations of real-world objects. You saw an example of this with a tic-tac-toe board.

# Practice Questions

[1](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/#calibre_link-1134). What does the code for an empty dictionary look like?

dictionary = {'':''}

[2](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/#calibre_link-1135). What does a dictionary value with a key 'foo' and a value 42 look like?

dictionary = {'foo': 42}

[3](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/#calibre_link-1136). What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list?
Dictionaries are unordered. Dictionaries contain keys and values. 


[4](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/#calibre_link-1137). What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?

You get a key error message, since there is no assigned key for foo in spam.

[5](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/#calibre_link-1138). If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?


cat in spam would show both the key and value, cat in spam.keys would show just the key.
1. Partially correct. Both `cat in spam` and `cat in spam.keys()` will check if the key `'cat'` exists in the dictionary `spam`. The difference is in the implementation; `cat in spam` directly checks the keys of `spam`, while `cat in spam.keys()` explicitly calls the `keys()` method to retrieve the keys before checking.


[6](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/#calibre_link-1139). If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?

cat in spam would show both the key and value, cat in spam.values would show just the value.

1. Partially correct. `cat in spam` will check if the key `'cat'` exists in the dictionary `spam`, while `cat in spam.values()` will check if the value `'cat'` exists in any of the values of the dictionary `spam`.



[7](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/#calibre_link-1140). What is a shortcut for the following code?

if 'color' not in spam:  
    spam['color'] = 'black'

you could do:
spam.setdefault('color', 'black')


[8](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/#calibre_link-1141). What module and function can be used to “pretty print” dictionary values?

you can use the pprint module using import pprint
then you can use the fucntion pprint.pprint method
