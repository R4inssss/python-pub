This is further research into chapter 8, which went over but did not explicitly cover the try/except block

# Try block:
OK, makes more sense now
It tries to pass through the initial command, where the try block is
In the case of multiplication quiz, it trys to run our variables of prompt through the regular expressions mad, using the parameters given.

# Except block:
The exception block, which is used when the try block fails to pass, runs the code in the confines of the exception block.

More specific exceptions go up top, and general ones down bellow.

# Else block:
else block runs code if the try clause does not run an exception
So, it allows you to run follow up code

# Finally:
Runs whether or not the code is successful or not
