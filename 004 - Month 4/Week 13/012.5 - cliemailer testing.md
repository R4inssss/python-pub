When using the webdriver function and passing the url ('https://mail.google.com'), it redirects to:
https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2Fu%2F0%2F&emr=1&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2Fu%2F0%2F&ifkv=AS5LTAR3nTA-glkLKwrYdJlDKtFZYOVsuJiM4G2WGb079mUGjOpxl87AbYnTZPRe_-MLCDVrnMzBSQ&osid=1&passive=1209600&service=mail&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin&dsh=S-1409191022%3A1719414290425776&ddm=0

We need a way to find the element attribute for email input. When using inspect element on Firefox, since we're using firefox, we expand the parant divs until we find:
![[Pasted image 20240626081048.png]]
where we see an input id!
Here, inputid = "identifierID"

Well, a cool way to send keys.. is to send_keys!

code as of now:
```python
#! python3  
#       cliemailerv2.py - takes an email and string of text from cli  
#       uses selenium to log into email and send an email given the email and string from cli  
  
  
from selenium import webdriver  
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys  
  
  
def cliemail():  
    browser = webdriver.Firefox()  
    browser.get('https://mail.google.com')  
    emailElem = browser.find_element_by_tag_name('identifierId')  
    emailElem.send_keys('email')  
    emailElem.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)  
  
  
cliemail()  
  
# Userid variable  
# Password variable
```

Which in turn, spat out errors, namely:
```powershell
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate element: identifierID
```

Ok, so we clearly need a different way to parse for information, or rather read it. We initially verified that the identifier is there, but maybe the attribute name is different, or rather how it is classified.

Thank you stackoverflow for your service :)
[From here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27112731/selenium-common-exceptions-nosuchelementexception-message-unable-to-locate-ele) we derived that we can us a By method with selenium, using the By.ID allows us to locate our elements using an attribute id.
Where my code was wrong before was that identifierID is not a tag name, but rather an attribute ID.

```python
#! python3  
#       cliemailerv2.py - takes an email and string of text from cli  
#       uses selenium to log into email and send an email given the email and string from cli  
  
  
from selenium import webdriver  
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys  
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By  
  
  
def cliemail():  
    browser = webdriver.Firefox()  
    browser.get('https://mail.google.com')  
    emailElem = browser.find_element(By.ID, 'identifierId')  
    emailElem.send_keys('email')  
    emailElem.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)  
  
  
cliemail()  
  
# Userid variable  
# Password variable
```

WHICH WORKS, WOOOOOOOOOO 

---
next, i added variables and inputs for user id and password.
BUT... a thing I noticed was that you can see the email, which is fine for me, but you can also see the password, which is not ok.
so we import getpass! 

Which is strange, because when i run it in a test:
```python
#! python3  
#       cliemailerv2.py - takes an email and string of text from cli  
#       uses selenium to log into email and send an email given the email and string from cli  
  
  
from selenium import webdriver  
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys  
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By  
import getpass  
  
  
def cliemail():  
    email = input('Enter your email: ')  
    password = getpass.getpass('Enter your password: ')  
    browser = webdriver.Firefox()  
    browser.get('https://mail.google.com')  
    emailElem = browser.find_element(By.ID, 'identifierId')  
    emailElem.send_keys(email)  
    emailElem.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)  
    email.send_keys(password)  
    emailElem.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)  
  
  
# cliemail()
```

it returns the error:
```powershell
    email.send_keys(password)
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'send_keys'

```

HMMM
so I isolated the issue to test it:
```python
def test_pass():  
    password = getpass.getpass('Enter your password: ')  
    print(password)  
  
  
test_pass()
```

Which ask for a password, and prints it:
```powershell
Enter your password: 
'123

```

Since this works fine, it must be how the password is identified within python. 
which is weird, because when i print it:
```python
def test_pass():  
    password = getpass.getpass('Enter your password: ')  
    print(password)  
    print(type(password))  
  
  
test_pass()
```

```powershell
Enter your password: 
123
<class 'str'>

```

it classifies as a string, even in the event that I input integers, which goes against the error mentioned above.

So, I will test it inside of the original function:
