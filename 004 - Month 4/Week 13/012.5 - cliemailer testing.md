When using the webdriver function and passing the url ('https://mail.google.com'), it redirects to:
https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2Fu%2F0%2F&emr=1&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2Fu%2F0%2F&ifkv=AS5LTAR3nTA-glkLKwrYdJlDKtFZYOVsuJiM4G2WGb079mUGjOpxl87AbYnTZPRe_-MLCDVrnMzBSQ&osid=1&passive=1209600&service=mail&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin&dsh=S-1409191022%3A1719414290425776&ddm=0

We need a way to find the element attribute for email input. When using inspect element on Firefox, since we're using firefox, we expand the parant divs until we find:
![[Pasted image 20240626081048.png]]
where we see an input id!
Here, inputid = "identifierID"

Well, a cool way to send keys.. is to send_keys!

code as of now:
```python
#! python3  
#       cliemailerv2.py - takes an email and string of text from cli  
#       uses selenium to log into email and send an email given the email and string from cli  
  
  
from selenium import webdriver  
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys  
  
  
def cliemail():  
    browser = webdriver.Firefox()  
    browser.get('https://mail.google.com')  
    emailElem = browser.find_element_by_tag_name('identifierId')  
    emailElem.send_keys('email')  
    emailElem.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)  
  
  
cliemail()  
  
# Userid variable  
# Password variable
```

Which in turn, spat out errors, namely:
```powershell
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate element: identifierID
```

Ok, so we clearly need a different way to parse for information, or rather read it. We initially verified that the identifier is there, but maybe the attribute name is different, or rather how it is classified.

Thank you stackoverflow for your service :)
[From here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27112731/selenium-common-exceptions-nosuchelementexception-message-unable-to-locate-ele) we derived that we can us a By method with selenium, using the By.ID allows us to locate our elements using an attribute id.
Where my code was wrong before was that identifierID is not a tag name, but rather an attribute ID.

```python
#! python3  
#       cliemailerv2.py - takes an email and string of text from cli  
#       uses selenium to log into email and send an email given the email and string from cli  
  
  
from selenium import webdriver  
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys  
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By  
  
  
def cliemail():  
    browser = webdriver.Firefox()  
    browser.get('https://mail.google.com')  
    emailElem = browser.find_element(By.ID, 'identifierId')  
    emailElem.send_keys('email')  
    emailElem.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)  
  
  
cliemail()  
  
# Userid variable  
# Password variable
```

WHICH WORKS, WOOOOOOOOOO
